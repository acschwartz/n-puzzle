I split up the Korf 100 set for parallel processing

original = korf100_15puzzles  ("korfo100")


----start with 0 ---

[SET 1]  = "KORF10"  =  10_of_korf100_every10th
generated by taking every 10th element of korf100
[ACCUM = 10]

[SET 2] =  = "10 MORE Korf 10 XOR 20"  =  10more_kor100_10xor20  
generated by taking 
(10_of_korf100_every10th  XOR 20_of_korf100_every5th)
to give me another 10 UNIQUE inputs ( since i already did runs on korf10
and didn't want / need to repeat them)
[ACCUM = 20 unique]

[SET 3]
xor10xor20xor25 = (kor10 ^ korf20) ^ (korf25_every4th)
wanted more unique inputs
that's 35 more!
[ACCUM = 55 unique] woop!

But I will split set 3 into halves so I can run inputs faster in parallel
or even quarters hmmm....


[SET 4]
is the remaining 67 that haven't shown up in the other sets
(so s1^se2^set3). i'm gonna let some searches run unbounded on it
in the background just for fun... shrug
