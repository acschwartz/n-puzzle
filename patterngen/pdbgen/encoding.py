'''
What is my goal with the 8-puzzle subproblem? plug-and-play into the existing, working 8-puzzle generator
Input from Solver to DB ---> Subproblem State (Could just be encoded.... honestly thats seems betterm to have an 
encoding function.
Maybe I could generate a parallel database to see if they give the same value? yeah that sounds cool...
The only "encoding" i'd need to look stuff up in the 8-puzzle database is the mappings of the tiles
so I can generate the database key
